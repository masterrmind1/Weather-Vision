        <h2>Fine Particles (PM 2.5) </h2>
        <p> Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is an air pollutant that is a concern for people's health when levels in air are high. PM2.5 are tiny particles in the air that reduce visibility and cause the air to appear hazy when levels are elevated. Outdoor
            PM2.5 levels are most likely to be elevated on days with little or no wind or air mixing. The New York State Departments of Health (DOH) and Environmental Conservation (DEC) alert the public by issuing a PM2.5 Health Advisory when PM2.5 concentrations
            in outdoor air are expected to be unhealthy for sensitive groups.</p>

        <h2>What is Particulate Matter 2.5 (PM2.5)?</h2>
        <p>The term fine particles, or particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5). Like inches, meters and miles, a micron is a unit of measurement for distance. There are about 25,000 microns in an inch. The widths of the larger particles in the PM2.5 size range would
            be about thirty times smaller than that of a human hair. The smaller particles are so small that several thousand of them could fit on the period at the end of this sentence.</p>
